        <h3 style="width:100%;text-align:center;">A Fee-less Overcollateralized Autonomous-reserve Stablecoin Protocol</h3>

        <h3><br><br><br><br><br><br>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          We propose the Kudisika Protocol, a “feeless” crypto-collateralized stablecoin protocol; for every amount that is minted, its equivalent fiat-backed stablecoin value will be held in an autonomous reserve. Unlike the conventional mobile money infrastructure known to citizens in most countries, there will be no fees nor electronic levies or mobile money taxes. Unlike almost all cryptocurrency transactions, our stablecoins’ users will not pay for gas fees.
        </p>

        <h3 id="doc-intro"><br><br><br><br><br><br>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Stablecoins have been a mainstay of the crypto industry since they first emerged in 2014 with Tether being the first major token to gain widespread use and attention. As of 2023, Tether has a global daily average volume of over $27 billion, significantly higher than that of even Bitcoin itself. Stablecoins have gone from usage in less than 10% to over 50% of global crypto trading volume as of June 2023. It has become clear that most of the growth in the cryptocurrency market today is led and fueled by stablecoin demand. Although there are many ways to categorize stablecoins, two distinct design concepts have stood out over time: collateralized stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins. Variations of each type have been tested with degrees of success (or lack thereof), collateralized stablecoins are usually sub-categorized into either crypto-collateralized (MakerDAO’s Dai) or fiat-collateralized tokens (Tether or USD Coin), with both subgroups having had significant adoption. Algorithmic stablecoins have had almost no meaningful traction and several devastating failures although various high profile attempts have been made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kudisika stablecoins are feeless, fiat-pegged, and crypto-collateralized – with a fully autonomous reserve which holds stablecoins like USDT. Our blockchain of choice is the OKT Chain which is developed by OKX.
        </p>

        <h3 id="doc-stables"><br><br>Stablecoins</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone loves money, just as no one likes to lose money. The cryptocurrency market is a volatile one which frequently results in loss of funds. We applied the most trustless approach to building a decentralized finance infrastructure tailored specifically for Africans. If a rich person doesn't want to lose money, then the average person definitely wouldn't want to be within a kilometer of the least chance to lose money. Volatility is when the price of an asset is not stable but rather keeps fluctuating as a result of demand and supply; today a unit of that asset is $5, tomorrow it is $2.87, essentially losing value overnight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial stablecoin implementations of the Kudisika Protocol is Sika (SIKA) which is pegged to the Ghanaian Cedi and Kudisika USD (KUSD) which is pegged to the United States Dollar. Being feeless means users are not charged any gas fees nor transaction fees for money transfers, thus making these stablecoins the ideal mobile money for everyday transactions. KUSD especially serves as a unique Store Of Value with which users can exchange their monies for in order to circumvent the ever-plunging price of their local currency (i.e. if you live in a mismanaged or ruined economy). Being crypto-collateralized means that minting any of them only requires placing an accepted crypto-based collateral into the minting smart contract. Our current implementation of the protocol will only accept on-chain stablecoins as collateral to minimize volatility of the reserve value, hence KUSD will be the collateral required to mint SIKA.
        </p>
        <p>
          SIKA and KUSD will be listed on the decentralized exchange of Kudisika only, which isn't an automatic market maker (AMM) like UniSwap, SushiSwap, etc. Our exchange ensures "zero volatility" for our stablecoins aside that of their fiat counterpart since it has no demand and supply side effects. Hence, as an example 1 SIKA will always be equal to 1 GHS (Cedi), and 1 KUSD equal to 1 USD (US Dollar), whereas 1 USDC is not always equal to 1 USD (US Dollar). Stability brings prominence and our design will prove to be the most resilient, transparent, trustless, and scalable stablecoin protocol.
        </p>

        <h3 id="doc-utility"><br><br>Kudisika Token</h3>
        <p>
          Kudisika (KDSK) token is created as a volatile value-accrual investment asset in the protocol which will be sold on OKTC Swap (an open-market AMM DEX) to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bootstrap liquidity for the protocol’s stablecoins.
          </li>

          <li>
            Realize our innovative "low-tariff" design by providing liquidity to absorb transaction fees until revenue from multiple source can sustainably takeover.
          </li>

          <li>
            Realize our innovative "zero-volatility" design in being able to absorb rate shocks of the fiat peg such as the GHS/USD rate.
          </li>

          <li>
            Help absorb the constant price fluctuations of the underlying assets (e.g. USDC or USDT).
          </li>

          <li>
            Help cover initial reserve cross-chain bridging costs.
          </li>

          <li>
            Help maintain a 110% over-collateralized reserve should the underlying assets fall.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It will be largely deflationary as there will be periodic buybacks using 70% of revenue accrued from the protocol's decentralized exchange in perpetuity.
        </p>

        <h3 id="doc-reserve"><br><br>Reserve Autonomy</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em>&ldquo;The good thing about computer programs is that they do what they're programmed to do, the bad thing about computer programs is that they do what they're programmed to do.&rdquo;</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Blockchains and Smart Contracts are computer programs designed to be immutable, thus once you publish a smart contract; what is written is written forever and can't be updated like normal computer programs, unless a new version is written and publish... this new version will not replace nor overwrite the old version, hence it'll be an entirely new smart contract on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The on-chain reserve of the Kudisika Decentralized Exchange (DEX) smart contract is autonomous in the sense that even the team have no way of withdrawing assets from it, hence like everyone else, one must place in acceptable stablecoins to mint SIKA, and place in SIKA to redeem the underlying assets; in short, your money is safe! We have a simple "No Human Control" policy.
        </p>

        <h3 id="doc-collateral"><br><br>Collateralization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Kudisika (KDSK) will be sold for USD stablecoins hence serving as its backing asset.
          </li>

          <li>
            Kudisika USD (KUSD) will be minted from 70% of the USD value of Staked KDSK (stKDSK).
          </li>

          <li>
            Sika (SIKA) will be backed by and minted up to 80% of KUSD’s market cap.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="doc-nomics"><br><br>Tokenomics</h3>
        <p>
          KDSK maximum supply will be fixed at 1 million, divided into several allocations.
        </p>
        <p>
          1% (10,000 KDSK) which will be allocated to the Founding Team and will be locked for 1 year to help secure the protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          12.5% (125,000 KDSK) of the maximum supply will be allocated to early adopters who will participate in a prelaunch sale which will be open for a period of 24-72 hours in which investors can garner up KDSK by contributing USD stablecoins into a treasury wallet, this prelaunch sale will have the most attractive price, tokens sold will be locked up in the buyer’s wallet for 21 days to prevent shorting the public sale; a portion of the contributed funds will be used to prepare and promote the project for a superior public sale.
        </p>

        <p>
          The third allocation is 40% (400,000 KDSK) of the maximum supply which will be used as liquidity for our Initial DEX Offering (IDO) or public sale for KDSK/USDC or KDSK/USDT pair. This will facilitate immediate price discovery and provide liquidity for the entire protocol. The Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens issued by the OKTC Swap will be owned by the Founding Team and vested for 1 year to preserve liquidity for the market.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fourth is 34% which will be allocated to our Staking Pool from which users who decide to lock their funds will earn a fixed APY.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The remaining 12.5% will be airdropped to enthusiastic community members, crypto educators, local crypto advocacy groups, etc and locked for a period of 91 days, after which it can be spent.

        <h3 id="doc-defi"><br><br>Decentralized Finance</h3>
        <p>
          Building tokens are half the task, utilization and adoption takes the other half. Luckily Decentralized Finance (DeFi) presents the opportunity to solving these problems; our initial DeFi products are:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Zero-Slippage Non-AMM WYSIWYG Decentralized Exchange:</strong> To realize the feeless and zero volatility design of our stablecoins, the need for a "statically-priced" decentralized exchange was inevitable; one with the cheapest trade fee of 0.2% on the traded amount while almost 95% of all DEXes charge about 0.3%. Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order actually executes; as an example, buying 200 ABC tokens may end up on your wallet as 198.7 ABC because the calculated amount you saw before executing the trade would have changed by the time the smart contract actually executed your order. Our exchange doesn't have this side effect and as such What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG). All these features allow traders to exchange one token (such as KUSD) for another (such as SIKA) without worrying about on-chain assets depreciation, excessive fees, nor transfer amount limitations. The non-automated market-maker nature of our decentralized exchange gives way for us to implement a "zero volatility" design which isn't much different from that of a traditional forex bureau, trading with a forex bureau does not have an impact on the price of the traded currencies; prices are based on international open market exchange prices; in our case prices are sourced from leading centralized crypto exchanges, this way traders can always be reassured that their trades won't experience rate shocks.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Crypto Ramp:</strong> A crypto ramp is a web service that serves as a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp that allows users to buy crypto with cash and a crypto-to-fiat off-ramp that allows users to cash out. Physical face-to-face cash trading via registered agents similar to mobile money agents or vendors who earn a commission on each cash trade they facilitate have been made available; thus laying the path for easy adoption of our stablecoins and solving the decade-old problem of not-so-cheap mobile money charges and the not-so-old insensitive mobile money taxes or electronic levies. Only two agents will be registered per square kilometer of a geographical area, thus minimizing competition and creating an abundant market for agents. Agents earn 0.5% commission on cash-ins and 0.4% commission on cash-outs. The minimum amount required to be eligible for agent registration is 6,250 KDSK. To register as an agent, please talk to the admins in our Telegram group or send a direct message to our Twitter account.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Staking Pool:</strong> Staking is a great way to attract new customers and can be an excellent way to increase one's KDSK token holdings. It is the process of depositing and locking up your KDSK tokens into the protocol for a specific period of time to provide economic security; ensuring there is enough liquidity to meet the DeFi needs to the protocol and in turn earn daily interest pro-rata by receiving Staked KDSK (stKDSK) tokens over time as well as benefiting from KDSK token price appreciations via demand and buybacks. StKDSK can be exchanged for KDSK at a 1:1 ratio. Our staking pool functions indirectly as a Liquidity Pool, in that it enable swaps on our decentralized exchange by making liquidity available for trading. Yields comes from a multitude of revenue sources which include 70% of fees, 40% of the KDSK tokens total supply allocated to the staking pool, profit from crypto trading via an artificial intelligence as well as holding a basket of cryptocurrencies (including but not limited to BTC, ADA, MATIC, TON, BCH, FTM, FIL) using the remaining 30% of the protocol fees.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the aim of encouraging long-term participation in the protocol, we minimize the risk investors face in most DeFi staking protocols (the most significant being adverse price movement in the staked assets possibly negating the APY earned) via our hybrid staking pool design which has built-in impermanent loss protection to ensure our investors are never worse off for depositing into the pool thanks to both the locking mechanism and periodic buybacks. After the staking pool funds are depleted, periodic buybacks of the KDSK token will commence resulting in price appreciation. After the locking period is over, the user can choose to unstake his/her tokens, since staking implies that you will be able to withdraw your initial deposit plus any earnings without experiencing any losses. Our DeFi staking design offers "fixed" class-leading interest rates or properly termed Annualized Percentage Yields (APYs) as excellent incentives for crypto enthusiasts willing to stake (lock-up) their assets to earn compounded passive income. The priority in this economic design is to accrue maximal value to the KDSK token in providing liquidity for our stablecoins. The staking interests are distributed everyday at 12:00 P.M. (GMT).

        <h3 id="doc-innovation"><br><br>A Digital Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          Without innovation, there isn’t anything new, and without anything new, there will be no progress. If a nation isn’t making any progress, it simply cannot stay relevant in the competitive world. Although innovation can have some undesirable consequences, change is inevitable and in most cases, innovation creates positive change. Lacking the drive to change - can be dangerous because it means that you could be left behind whilst everyone around you is running miles ahead (because they decided to innovate). Your complacency could put you at a disadvantage because you may miss out on the benefits of a fresh, updated mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's the critical need for a rapid radical change. For the sins of "the corrupt", "the deceptive", and "the gullible", the economies of over 70% of African countries have been plunged into utter ruin, it is therefore only logical for the capable to help build a transparent, accountable, and incorruptible future. A future free from the corrupt control of government; this is the very problem which blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies solve; the very reason why the first blockchain and cryptocurrency named Bitcoin was created. As always, <strong>DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Stubbornness (and a lack of willingness to innovate) can leave you in a dangerous position, especially when everyone around you is innovating. Knowledge drives innovation, innovation drives productivity, productivity drives economic growth. The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but building on the new. When the winds of change blow, some people build walls and others build windmills. The best way to predict the future is to create it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fewer words, <em>innovation is progress in the face of tradition</em>. You can’t allow tradition to get in the way of innovation. There’s a need to respect the past, but it’s a mistake to revere your past.
        </p>
